For a coordinate, the empirical distribution functions $F$ and $F_A$ are calculated, where $F$ is the CDF of all shot coordinates and $F_A$ is the CDF looking at all shot coordinates where the shot was taken by the visiting team. There are a handful of neutral-site venues. In these games, the away-team was chosen to be the team determined by the NHL to be the visiting team for that game.\n",
    "In a similar fashion, empirical distribution functions $F_V$ and $F_{VA}$ are calculated for each venue independently. Here, $F_V$ is the CDF for all shots at that venue and $F_{VA}$ is the CDF for all shots by the visiting team at that venue.\n",
    "Using these ECDFs, an adjusted quantile `q` is calculated for each coordinate `c` to be $q(c) = F_V(c) - (F_{VA}(c) - F_A(c)).$  This quantile is adjusted to be in the interval $[0,1]$ by taking $q'(c) = \\min(\\max(q(c), 0), 1).$ Finally, the adjusted coordinate `c'` is calculated by $F^{-1}(q')$. The adjusted coordinates are assigned to variables `adj_x` and `adj_y`."
